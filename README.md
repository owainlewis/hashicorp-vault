# Hashicorp Vault

This is a Haskell library for working with Hashicorp Vault.

## API Responses

All API responses are consistent in that they return a (VaultResponse a)

In the case of an error a VaultFailure type is returned with the status code and error messages
generated by the vault API

```haskell

module App where

import qualified Network.Vault as Vault

Vault.init (initReq { secretShares = 1, secretThreshold = 1 })

-- VaultFailure 400 (VaultErrors {errors = ["Vault is already initialized"]})
```
